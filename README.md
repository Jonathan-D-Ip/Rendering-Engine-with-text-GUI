# Rendering-Engine-with-text-GUI
A simple project to use Python to demonstrate using pure python with no graphic library to render primitives. Feel free to optimize and add new features. I think this is a good project to act as a demonstration to facilitate learning, especially for computer graphics students.

# To tun the program, simply run the following command :
```bash
python Main.py
```
# Required Library included :
1. Tkinter
2. math
